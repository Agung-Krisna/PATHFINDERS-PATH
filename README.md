# PATHFINDERS-PATH
This is a pathfinding visualizer that I created to demonstrate the differences between Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm and A* pathfinding algorithms. <br>Written in python3.

## Algorithms
Currently I can only code for Dijkstra and A* algoritms only, but I'd wish to add more algorithms into the visualizer in the future.

### Packages required
The package that would be required to install the game would be pygame.<br>
If you wish to install the pygame, you can type this into your terminal:<br>
` pip3 install pygame `
